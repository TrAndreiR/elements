## ➤ How to use it

- Install the package of dialog

```shell
$ npm i @tradeshift/elements.dialog --save
```

- Import the component

```js
import '@tradeshift/elements.dialog';
```

or

```html
<script src="node_modules/@tradeshift/elements.dialog/lib/dialog.umd.js"></script>
```

- Use it like [demo]("https://tradeshift.github.io/elements/?path=/story/ts-dialog--default")

- Our components rely on having the `Open Sans` available, You can see the `font-weight` and `font-style` you need to load [here](https://github.com/Tradeshift/elements/blob/master/packages/core/src/fonts.css), or you can just load it from our package (for now)

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="node_modules/@tradeshift/elements/src/fonts.css" />
```

## ➤ Polyfills

For supporting IE11 you need to add couple of things

- Don't shim CSS Custom Properties in IE11

```html
<!-- Place this in the <head>, before the Web Component polyfills are loaded -->
<script>
	if (!window.Promise) {
		window.ShadyCSS = { nativeCss: true };
	}
</script>
```

##### You have two options for polyfills library:

1. Use [`@open-wc/polyfills-loader`](https://github.com/open-wc/open-wc/tree/master/packages/polyfills-loader)

- Installation

```shell
$ npm i @open-wc/polyfills-loader
```

- Load it

```js
import loadPolyfills from '@open-wc/polyfills-loader';

loadPolyfills().then(() => import('./my-app.js'));
```

2. Use [`@webcomponents/webcomponentsjs`](https://github.com/webcomponents/polyfills/tree/master/packages/webcomponentsjs)

- Installation

```hell
$ npm i @webcomponents/webcomponentsjs --save
```

- Enable ES5 class-less Custom Elements

```html
<script src="/node_modules/@webcomponents/webcomponentsjs/custom-elements-es5-adapter.js"></script>
```

- Load appropriate polyfills and shims with [`@webcomponents/webcomponentsjs`](https://github.com/webcomponents/webcomponentsjs)

```html
<script src="/node_modules/@webcomponents/webcomponentsjs/webcomponents-loader.js" defer></script>
```
